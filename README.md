### Styling
- I have decided to use inline styling instead of tailwind CSS or bootsrap, as it will showcase my skills.
> I realised that we can use nested css in native css without using sass


### Upper-bar
I first searched this logo on google and found this website https://www.freepnglogos.com/ ,so i am using its link for the logo on top-right also i noticed that on the first slide there is no search bar, I will keep it there but make its { display : 'none' }

this needs to be updated
